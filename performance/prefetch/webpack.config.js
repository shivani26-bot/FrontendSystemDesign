// npm run build: it will create a dist folder where we have the compressed version of our app in main.js file , we can see the file size of main.js in network tab
// in production build it has size of 11 kb
// after using gzip, the production build file is reduced to 1kb

// If you refresh your production app and still see the JavaScript file as 11 KB in size instead of the smaller gzip-compressed version, it indicates that the server is not configured to serve gzip files. To resolve this, you need to make changes to the server setup to enable gzip compression.

// Hereâ€™s what needs to be done:

// Set Up an Nginx Server:

// We will set up an Nginx server on an Ubuntu machine hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance.
// Enable Gzip Compression:

// On the Nginx server, we will configure gzip compression. This involves modifying the Nginx configuration file to ensure the server serves compressed versions of JavaScript and other static files.
// Deploy the Production Build:

// Deploy the production build of the application to the Nginx server.
// Verify the Gzip Files:

// After enabling gzip compression, the server will serve the compressed files, significantly reducing their size compared to the original uncompressed files.

//entry:First, we need to tell webpack where to start bundling the javascript files, this we can do by specifying entry property
// output:Here we tell webpack to create the final bundled file in dist folder in the root of the project.
// Once the bundled javascript file is created we need to tell webpack to inject it as a script tag to the HTML file. To do that we first need to install a webpack plugin that will help us do it.
// plugins:This will take the /public/index.html and inject script tag to it. And move that HTML file to the dist folder.
// We now need to tell webpack to transpile javascript files using babel before bundling them. To do that we need to define some rules for the module bundling.
