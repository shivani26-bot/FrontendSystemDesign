// resolver
// A resolver determines the exact query that needs to be executed when someone wants to fetch a user. It specifies the actions required to retrieve
//  a particular type of data. Similarly, when someone needs to find a problem, the resolver outlines the necessary query to execute in order to fetch
//   that specific problem.

// When a query is run, either for users or for problems, the resolver defines which command or database call should be made. It structures the
//  SQL query to fetch the correct user data or the related user problems.
// The only resolver weâ€™ll need is for the problems and solvers fields because ID and name can be automatically resolved. However, since problems
// and solvers are related fields, GraphQL cannot automatically understand how to generate the data for these fields. Therefore, we need to define a
//  resolver to specify how to fetch the problems and solvers correctly.

// Resolver - A server function that fulfills a request of a certain field. Usually, the first resolver to be called is the query/mutation resolver,
//  followed by the resolver of every field returned in the response.

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    // write your database calls or raw sqls
